## QCoDeS_Project (Summer 2022)
This repository contains reports summarizing the QCoDeS related project work completed at the Silicon Quantum Computing Lab at IIT, Bombay. 
I used QCoDeS to automate an array of instruments like an AWG, pre-amp, high precision digital volt meter, etc. and used QCoDeS (and related libraries) to carry out measurements on samples fabricated by lab members, like characterization of Al oxide used as insulation of the top gate on a hall-bar sample. 

I have continued working at the QSi-Lab post summer. Updates regarding this work coming soon!
